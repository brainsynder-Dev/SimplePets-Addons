### How to submit a new SimplePets Addon
If you would like to submit an addon you have made, then simply open an [ADDON SUBMISSION](https://github.com/brainsynder-Dev/SimplePets-Addons/issues/new/choose) form and we will look at it (to make sure it is not harmful for servers)

### I have an update for my addon
